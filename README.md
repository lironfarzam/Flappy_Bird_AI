## About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a project I made to learn about neural networks and genetic algorithms. The game is a clone of the popular game Flappy Bird. The ai learns to play the game using a genetic algorithm. The game is made using the pygame library.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
To run the game you need to have python 3.7 or higher installed. You also need to install the pygame library. To install pygame run the following command in the terminal:
```
pip install pygame
```
To run the game run the following command in the terminal:
```
python main.py
```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

The game is played by pressing the space bar to jump. The ai learns to play the game by itself. The ai is trained using a genetic algorit
m. The ai i
s trained by creating a population of birds. Each bird has a neural network that controls when it jumps. The birds that perform the best are selected to reproduce. The birds that perform the worst are removed from the population. The birds that are selected to reproduce are mutated and crossed over to create the next generation of birds. The process is repeated until the birds are able to play the game.
